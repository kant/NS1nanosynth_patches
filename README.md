# Nanosynth-Experiments
a place to store my NS! Nanosynth experiments as well as the NS1 Fritzing Patch and his paper version

# How to use!

Basic, you really need to have a [NS1 Nanosynth](https://store.arduino.cc/product/E000083) by Soundmachines and a certain number of cables. 

At this point, you can mess around with the manual or take notes yourself about the patches you create printing "NS1 Notebook Sample Page" pdf file.

If you are using [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/), you can use the [NS1 Fritzing part](https://github.com/vongomben/Nanosynth-Experiments) in order to let everybody saving their patches.

We've released several new sounds. You can read them here or hear them on [our sound cloud tracklist](https://soundcloud.com/soundmachines_it/sets/ns1nanosynth-basic-patches-and)

Add your patches (by making a simple pull request!)

- download the zip file by pressing "Download Zip button"
- print NS1 Notebook Sample Page.pdf if you need to take notes
- add the NS1 Nanosynth by SoundMachines.fzpz file to your [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) parts by following [this guide](http://fritzing.org/learning/tutorials/creating-custom-parts/)

enjoy!
